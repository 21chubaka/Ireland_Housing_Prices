## Introduction
This project will use data from The Residential Property Price Register (RPPR) to create
various Machine Learning models to predict property prices in Ireland, then compare the performances
of the models.<br>

## Requirements
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Sklearn<br>

## Data
Property Services Regulatory Authority (PSRA) - The Residential Property Price Register (RPPR) for 2010-2021<br>
Features:<br>
- Date of Sale (dd/mm/yyyy):    object

- Postal Code:                  object
- County:                       object

- Not Full Market Price:        object
- VAT Exclusive:                object
- Description of Property:      object

Central Statistics Office provided by the government of Ireland - Income Per Person and Income Indices by County by Year for 2010-2019<br>
Features:<br>
- Year:                                  int64
- County:                              string
- Income_Indices:                      float64
- Income_Per_Person_euro:              float64

## Data Cleaning
Intial data exploration was carried out to better understand the RPPR data and identify any data cleaning that needed to be carried out before
modeling.<br>
### Initial Descriptive Statistics on Continuous Features

### Initial Descriptive Statistics on Categorical Features

Some integrity checks on the dataset were:
- Check for Null Values by Column
- Check for Negative Price Values
- Check for Future Dates
- Check for Month Values Greater than 12 or Less than 1
- Check for Day Values Greater than 31 or Less than 1
- Check for Year Values Older than 2010
- Check for 'Second-hand Dwellings' with 'Yes' VAT Exclusive
- Check for Outliers by Column
- Etc.

### 'Price (€)' feature
The 'Price (€)' feature contained outliers that were signficantly skewing the data, especially upper bound outliers.  The impact of the outliers
can be observed from the boxplot below.

### 'Postal Code' feature
The 'Postal Code' feature had 8,086 rows with NULL values and some with missing values.  This feature also had some Dublin Postal Codes labeled as
'Baile Atha Cliath', which is Dublin in Irish.

### 'Description of Property' feature
The 'Description of Property' feature had some labels in Irish.

### 'Property Size Description' feature
The 'Property Size Description' feature had 8,984 rows with NULL values.  This feature also had two labels for the same size description of
'greater than 125 sq meters'.

### Data Cleaning Plan

For the purposes of this project, I will translate these to Dublin for the continuity of data.
In addition there were some changes to feature names, exculsions of symbols in the price feature, and updates to data types to facilitate better
analysis.<br>
